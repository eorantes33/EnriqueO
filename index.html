  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Enrique Orantes, I am a student at Cerritos College and I plan to learn how to become a cybersecurity analyst. 
    I am still new to computers but I am not new to playing video games on them. The first game I ever played was Call of Duty on my old HP desktop. 
    I instantly fell in love with video games which is one of my many passions. I love this time of year (fall) because football season gets underway. 
    My #1 passion over everything is my German Shepard Bruce, who is 3 years old, and unlike most dogs he is a bad dog but I still love him regardless. 
    I am excited to start this semester learning how to build websites and learning how to defend networks!</p>
<h2>When I have free time</h2>
<ol>
    <li>I like lifting weights and running</li>
    <li>I love to play video games</li>
    <li>I love shooting at the gun range </li>
  </ol> 
  <p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">https://www.reddit.com/</a> because it is very interesting and entertaining to browse.</p>
